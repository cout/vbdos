This is a list of all the programs that I have worked on in that past that
I've been able to dig up from over the years. I figured I'd try to make
a page of these, mainly for nostalgic reasons, and perhaps to help new
programmers who are coming along in the world (though most of this stuff
is so old it probably won't be of much use).

<P>Please do not email me concerning obtaining a copy of Visual BASIC for
DOS.  Yes, I own a copy, but my disks are corrupted, and are no longer
installable.  You may still be able to get a copy from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, or get PowerBASIC and
a windowing library and you can still have just as much fun.
<P>Except as noted in the documentation, all of the programs here that
<i>I wrote</i> are now being released into public domain.&nbsp; Please note
that there may be some programs here which are not fully mine; though I am not
sure who the original authors are in all cases, I have tried to make that
clear wherever I can.

<TD>SmartTerm</TD>

<TD>A terminal emulation program for MS-DOS that I wrote a while back.&nbsp;

Most programs can do this, but are slower when interpreting ANSI sequences
and writing to the screen.&nbsp; Never completed.&nbsp; Based on an ANSI
parser by Jason Farrell.
